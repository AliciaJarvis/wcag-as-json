#WCAG as JSON

This is a JSON formatted version of WCAG 2.0

We created this as a way to be able to quickly insert references to WCAG-related information into other documents.

## Structure

The structure of the JSON file closely mirrors the WCAG Standard itself:

* There are 4 core principles of WCAG
* Each Principle has Guidelines
* Each Guideline has Success Criteria

In this JSON format the Success Criteria themselves have been broken down further:

* Special Cases
* Notes


##License
The JSON formatted document has an MIT license.
